# Varshitha lavu
Generally, I'm an introvert who values exploration over expression. While I cherish moments of quiet introspection, I'm also deeply passionate about two things: dogs and the serene beauty of nature. I'm a caninophile, which means I have an abiding love for dogs, and I'm equally a naturephile, captivated by the breathtaking allure of the natural world. These passions bring joy and wonder to my life.  <br>In terms of technical interests, I have a strong passion for HTML and aspire to become a web developer. Lately, I've also been captivated by Markdown and am eager to explore it further through experimentation.<br>
